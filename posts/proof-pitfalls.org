* Induction

** Introducing too much.

   https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/draft/lf-current/Tactics.html#lab139

   By introducing a variable you are saying for a "particular"
   instance of that variable. Not for all such instances of the
   variable.

   Thus, when introducing more than necessary prior to induction you
   may unintentionally weaken the induction hypothesis that you will
   get, making it impossible to prove your goal.
